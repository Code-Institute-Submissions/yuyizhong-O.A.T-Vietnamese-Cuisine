# User-Experience-Design

## The-Strategy-Plan

### Site-Goals
The site is aimed for restaurant staff to easily manage the daily menus on the website, keep track of the costomers' feedbacks to monitor the quality of the food and reply to each review for better customer care pratice. 

The site also aims to provide customers the opportunity to leave reviews and make suggestions to the restaurant menus. They can also rate the food from 1 to 5 based on their experience and an average rating is automatically generated for indival dish. 

### Agile Planning

This project was developed through applying agile methodologies by delivering small features in incremental sprints.

All projects were assigned to epics, which were broken into small tasks and prioritized as must have, should have, could have. "Must have" stories were completed first before "should haves", and the last "could haves". To ensure all core requirements completed first gives a complete product, with the nice to have features being added if the time frame allows.

#### Epics

The project had 8 main Epics (milestones):

**EPIC 1 - Base Setup**

The base setup epic was the first epic to be delivered as all other features depend on the completion of the base setup.

**EPIC 2 - Small Pages**

Instead of creating epics for tiny features, all the small pages were included to this epic.

**EPIC 3 - Authentication Epic**

The authentication epic is for all stories related to the registration, login and authorization of views. It allows restaurant staff to CRUD menus and reply to user’s reviews securely and users to leave their messages after signed in.

**EPIC 4 - Menu**

The menu epic is for all stories that relate to the creating, editing, toggling, deleting, and viewing of menus. This allows for regular users to view menus and for staff to manage them with a simple UI interface.

**EPIC 5 – Reviews and Ratings**

The Reviews epic is for all stories related to creating, viewing the reviews and ratings to displayed menus at website. This allows the site users to easily view feedbacks of individual menu and also for signed in customers to leave reviews and ratings.

**EPIC 6 - Reply**

The Reply epic is for all stories related to creating, viewing the replies to customers’ reviews. This allows the site users to view the reply messages and also the restaurant staff to reply to user’s feedbacks.

**EPIC 7 - Deployment Epic**

This epic is for all stories related to deploying the app to heroku so that the site is live for staff and customer use.

**EPIC 8 - Documentation**

This epic is for all documents related stories and tasks to document the lifecycle of the project development. It aims to record the detailed documentations to all stages of development and necessary information on testing, deploying and running the application.
